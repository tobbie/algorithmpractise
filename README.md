# C# solutions to commmon data structures and algorithim problems

## Problems are sourced from algoexpert, leetcode and educative.io

The project is a group of class libraries that contain solutions to fairly common algorithm and data structure problems. 
The solutions are organised by difficulty (Easy  -  Very Hard) per algorithm or data striucture being solved for. A good number of the solutions have tests you can run to confirm they work.

### Data Structures covered inlcude :

	* Arrays
	* LinkedLists
	* Strings
	* Graphs
	* Heaps
	* Stacks
	* Trees - Binary Search Trees and Binary Trees
	* Trie  - Prefix Trie and Suffix Trie

### Algorithims covered include :
	* Sorting
	* Searching
	* Recursion
	* Greedy
	* BitwiseOperation
	* Dynamic Programming
	* Sliding Window

In addition to the above, there's a class library project that contain common patterns to solve certian types of problems and another with
questions Microsoft asks at interviews

To get started, clone the repo, build the project, then run dotnet test so see all tests run.

This solution requires .NET 6 to run
