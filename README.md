# C# solutions to common data structures and algorithm problems

## Problems are sourced from algoexpert, leetcode and educative.io

The project is a group of class libraries that contain solutions to fairly common algorithm and data structure problems. 
The solutions are organised by difficulty (Easy  -  Very Hard) per algorithm or data structure being solved for. A good number of the solutions have tests you can run to confirm they work.

### Data Structures covered include:

	* Arrays
	* LinkedLists
	* Strings
	* Graphs - DFS, BFS
	* Heaps
	* Stacks
	* Queues
	* Trees - Binary Search Trees and Binary Trees
	* Trie  - Prefix Trie and Suffix Trie

### Algorithms covered include:
	* Sorting
	* Searching
	* Recursion
	* Greedy
	* BitwiseOperation
	* Dynamic Programming
	* Sliding Window

In addition to the above, there's a class library project that contains common patterns to solve certain types of problems and another with popular
Microsoft interview questions.

To get started, clone the repo, build the project, then run `dotnet test` to see all tests run.

This solution requires `.NET 6` to run. Happy coding! :)
